## Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment — Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes a Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Assessment dataset from Bangladesh, covering 1,529 patient records collected between January 2024 and January 2025.

The goal is to understand how demographics, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, biochemical markers, and lifestyle factors contribute to cardiovascular risk, and to translate these insights into clinical decision support and population-level risk intelligence.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

-Dataset Name: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment Dataset
-Region: Bangladesh 🇧🇩
-Source: Jamalpur Medical College Hospital
-Total Records: 1,529 patients
-Total Features: 22 clinical, biochemical, anthropometric & lifestyle variables
-Target Variables:

-CVD Risk Level (Low / Intermediate / High)

-CVD Risk Score (0–100)

-Feature Categories

-Demographic: Age, Sex

-Anthropometric: BMI, Waist-to-Height Ratio, Abdominal Circumference

-Clinical: Blood Pressure, BP Category

-Biochemical: Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Fasting Blood Sugar

-Lifestyle: Smoking, Diabetes, Physical Activity, Family History

## 🎯 Project Objectives

-Identify high-risk patient segments

-Understand hidden cardiovascular risk beyond BMI

-Evaluate non-linear risk escalation in BP & cholesterol

-Quantify lifestyle-driven risk accumulation

-Build decision-ready dashboards for clinicians

-Practice SQL-based clinical analytics

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
### 📊 Excel (Clinical & Exploratory Analytics)

-Risk banding & cohort segmentation

-Correlation analysis (BMI, waist, cholesterol vs risk)

-Lifestyle risk index construction

-Data validation & BMI audit

### 🧠 SQL (Healthcare Analytics – Interview Level)

-Demographic risk stratification

-Comorbidity-driven cohort analysis

-Obesity & lipid-driven risk modeling

-Identification of “clinically normal but high-risk” patients

### 📈 Tableau (Clinical Storytelling)

-Executive risk overview dashboard

-Lifestyle & demographic risk heatmaps

-Clinical driver analysis (BMI, BP, Cholesterol)

-End-to-end story: Population Risk → Hidden Threats

### 📊 Tableau Dashboards
#### 🔹 Dashboard 1 — Executive Risk Overview

KPIs:

-Total Patients

-% High Risk Patients

-Avg CVD Risk Score

-% Diabetic Patients

#### 🔹 Dashboard 2 — Demographic & Lifestyle Risk

-% High Risk by Age Band

-Smoking × Risk Level

-Lifestyle Risk Heatmap

#### 🔹 Dashboard 3 — Clinical & Metabolic Drivers

-BMI Category vs Risk

-BP Category vs Risk

-Cholesterol Band vs Risk

## 🧠 Key Insights

-Nearly half of patients fall into High CVD Risk

-Central obesity outperforms BMI in predicting risk

-Risk escalation with BP is non-linear

-Patients with normal BMI can still be high-risk due to lipids & diabetes

-Lifestyle risks compound significantly with age

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

-Healthcare-grade analytical thinking

-Strong Excel + SQL + Tableau integration

-Clinical risk modeling capability

-Interview-ready problem framing

-Applicability to health analytics, ML, and CDS systems
